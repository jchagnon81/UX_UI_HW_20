                                    <p>My name is Rachael and I was born to be a designer.  I enjoy spending hours dreaming about ideas, concepts, and far away lands. Traveling is my passion.
                                        I thrive on design challenges, and hope to be a part of an exciting team of artists someday.  
                                        I speak different languages with Spanish and English being my strongest.  I can follow other Romantic languages when reading them. I try to be as vegan as possible.
                                        I feel a deep empathy for the world and all its living creatures. My favorite food invovles salad and fresh juice.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I am originally from Seattle, Washington. I sure do miss the rain, but I love all the snow
                                        here in Colorado! Going outdoors is a must for me. Since I was young I have had a creative mind.  Over the years my artisitc skills have grown.  
                                        Today, I have an arsenal of abilities that apply to several design fields.  I studied Fine Art with a focus on Graphic Arts at Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, CO.  
                                        I now have a certificate from the University of Denver (Colorado) in UI UX Design.  I worked in prepress and printing for over 16 years.  I learned patience, managing multiple projects, 
                                        customer service relations, good graphic design practices, and photo editing.
                                        From there my knowledge extends to art history, psychology, sociology, ethics, morality, and religions.
                                        Please follow me on social media or contact me if you want to get to know me more.  I am open to networking and am seeking mentors.
                                    </p>
