                    We found that people want community in some form. The problem is, with people having a wide range of interests, our users - teenage girls - aren’t able to find programs within 
                    their school that fulfill those interests. This causes a lot of parents to turn to outside resources to get their daughters involved in extracurricular activities that they are actually 
                    interested in. Schools aren’t offering music and arts programs due to public funding issues. 
                    Girls Rock Denver was created to promote creativity within an empowering setting focusing on music and performance. While Girls Rock is primarily led by and for women and girls, they also value 
                    diversity, inclusion, and sensitivity towards all individuals regardless of gender identity or expression.
                    With such a powerful mission statement, we went straight to work on updating the UI of the website so that their values are prominent. We reworked the whole website from the sitemap to the actual 
                    information on each of the pages to make it easier for parents to locate the information that they need.

                <p>We started off our research with wanting to understand what’s important for making friendships among musically talented high school girls by focusing on three objectives:</p>
                    <h2>1. What motivates young women to join clubs/programs/groups? </h2>
                    <h2>2. What makes music enjoyable for the user?</h2>
                    <h2>3. What does girl empowerment mean to you?</h2>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="margin">
                <p>Based on our objectives, we were able to conduct user interviews with parents and their daughters. We also lead Instagram polls and Google Surveys to collect more data. 
                    The common themes we found through the various research was that the girls wanted a sense of community when joining a club and wanted a space free of judgement.  
                    Before jumping into designing, we ran a competitor analysis looking at School of Rock and Youth on Record for insight into what makes them successful. 
                    Cleaner navigation, better call to actions, and engaging photos were strengths from our competitors that we wanted to incorporate into the redesign of the Girls Rock website.

                            <p>Insights: During our user interviews, we discovered that most teenage girls are lacking creative, empowering experiences through programs at their schools, so they must look else where. 
                                Therefore, we believe that offering music programs outside of the school will benefit the community and that we might be able to help if we make these empowering programs more accessible. 
                                We might do this by designing community-centric and informative websites. Doing this will allow our product to offer a safe space for girls to explore their creativity.
                            </p>

                            <p>Problem Statement: We believe that designing websites for local non profits and parents of young ladies will promote friendship and community amongst musically inclined girls. 
                                Girls Rock Denver was designed to promote girls’ creativity in an empowering setting. We have observed that our product or service is hard to find inside a school setting, which is 
                                causing parents turn to their own social networks or websites for guidance. How might we improve Girls Rock Denver so that the website is more accessible?
                            </p>

                <p>
                    After compiling our data into an Affinity Diagram, we quickly found out that while it would be the teenagers that would be taking part in the program, a lot of the decision making and research 
                    of programs was done by the parents. We decided to shift our focus to research the parents and their perspective. This is how we came up with our final user persona, Sheila Robertson.
