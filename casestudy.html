                <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8"><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hat do young girls and their parents have in common?  They both want community in some form! The problem is, with people having a wide range of interests, our users - teenage girls - aren’t able to find programs within 
                    their school that fulfill those interests. This causes a lot of parents to turn to outside resources to get their daughters involved in extracurricular activities that they are actually 
                    interested in. Schools aren’t offering music and arts programs due to public funding issues. Girls Rock Denver was created to promote creativity within an empowering setting focusing on music and performance. While Girls Rock is primarily led by and for women and girls, they also value 
                    diversity, inclusion, and sensitivity towards all individuals regardless of gender identity or expression.
                    With such a powerful mission statement, we went straight to work on updating the UI of the website so that their values are prominent. We reworked the whole website from the sitemap to the actual 
                    information on each of the pages to make it easier for parents to locate the information that they need.

                <p>We started off our research with wanting to understand what’s important for making friendships among musically talented high school girls by focusing on three objectives:</p>
                    <h2>1. What motivates young women to join clubs/programs/groups? </h2>
                    <h2>2. What makes music enjoyable for the user?</h2>
                    <h2>3. What does girl empowerment mean to you?</h2>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="margin">
                <p>Based on our objectives, we were able to conduct user interviews with parents and their daughters. We also lead Instagram polls and Google Surveys to collect more data. 
                    The common themes we found through the various research was that the girls wanted a sense of community when joining a club and wanted a space free of judgement.  
                    Before jumping into designing, we ran a competitor analysis looking at School of Rock and Youth on Record for insight into what makes them successful. 
                    Cleaner navigation, better call to actions, and engaging photos were strengths from our competitors that we wanted to incorporate into the redesign of the Girls Rock website.

                    <div class="orange">
                        <div class="insight">
                            <p>Insights: During our user interviews, we discovered that most teenage girls are lacking creative, empowering experiences through programs at their schools, so they must look else where. 
                                Therefore, we believe that offering music programs outside of the school will benefit the community and that we might be able to help if we make these empowering programs more accessible. 
                                We might do this by designing community-centric and informative websites. Doing this will allow our product to offer a safe space for girls to explore their creativity.
                            </p>

                            <p>Problem Statement: We believe that designing websites for local non profits and parents of young ladies will promote friendship and community amongst musically inclined girls. 
                                Girls Rock Denver was designed to promote girls’ creativity in an empowering setting. We have observed that our product or service is hard to find inside a school setting, which is 
                                causing parents turn to their own social networks or websites for guidance. How might we improve Girls Rock Denver so that the website is more accessible?
                            </p>

            <div class="margin red">
                <p>
                    After compiling our data into an Affinity Diagram, we quickly found out that while it would be the teenagers that would be taking part in the program, a lot of the decision making and research 
                    of programs was done by the parents. We decided to shift our focus to research the parents and their perspective. This is how we came up with our final user persona, Sheila Robertson.

            <div class="margin">
                <p>This then led us to our journey map. Sheila first looks to her daughter’s school for a music/art program but can’t find any. She searches online, and through one of her facebook groups, she finds out 
                    about Girls Rock Denver. She goes to their website and reads about their focus on diversity, inclusion and empowerment and is intrigued by what this camp offers and ends up signing her daughter up 
                    for the Summer Rock Camp. She believes it will be the perfect fit for what her daughter wants. 
                </p>

                <p>Some of the opportunities to make this successful were to make information clear and easy to find on the site. We also wanted to design a website that was engaging for both the parent and their kid, 
                    and create opportunities for connections through a call to action.

                    <p>We had success with both (web and mobile) low fidelity prototypes, and also received feedback that helped build our mid-fi prototypes. 
                        A couple of users said that they thought the FAQ page we asked them to locate would be found in the footer, but since that wasn’t sketched out, they looked in the navigation menu. 
                        In our next iterations, we felt that including a link to the FAQ page in the footer would make it more accessible to the user.
                    </p>

                    <p>We continued testing on our mid-fidelity prototypes. We asked our users to perform the same three tasks:</p>  
                    <h2>1. Read about Girls Rock Denver through “HERstory.”</h2>
                    <h2>2. Find the FAQ page and learn more.</h2>

                <p>After creating our hi-fidelity prototypes, we tested again on Maze and had recorded tests for a final time. Overall, the feedback was positive and most users were successful with completing the tasks. 
                    We received feedback that while users were able to complete the tasks, they were confused by some of our buttons because they couldn’t differentiate the two. We decided to change up our wording to 
                    make clear that one was to apply for the programs, and one was to contact Girls Rock if they had further questions. We also moved the navigation menu on the mobile from the left to the right side, 
                    included a message form field for users. On the desktop version, you can see how we changed our wording to clearly define where buttons would lead the user.

                            <p>We had so much fun with this project and if we had more time, we would have loved to build out more pages, specifically the multimedia page. 
                                This would be a fun way to showcase the talents cultivated throughout the summer camp, and could potentially inspire more girls to sign up.
                                We unfortunately weren’t able to get in contact with our organization to get more information about Girls Rock and how they market their program, 
                                and it would be great to interview them in the future to see how they can connect more with schools. Community is everything! Everyone we surveyed 
                                or talked to had been part of a club or program in the past, or was looking to be in one. However, we were surprised to find out that schools don’t offer a 
                                lot of music or arts programs. We hope that more programs like this will be known about and provide better engagement with those seeking these out.
